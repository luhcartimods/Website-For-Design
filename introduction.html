        <h1>What Is Littering?</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="literis">
        <p>Littering is the improper disposal of waste products. While it can happen by mistake (as in an unsecured object flying out of the bed of a truck), littering continues to be largely a deliberate act. Whether it happens intentionally or unintentionally, littering has environmental consequences. Littering is a problem worldwide and is a problem seen everywhere and affects everyone, littering emerged more in the 1950s and came about more because of the rise of the mass production of plastic products and produtcs including plastic, the first litter act was even in 1958 and littering was already seen as a problem back then, now littering is a global issue and is polluting our world more and more day by day and many people want to help fix littering but they just cant because there are too many people aimlessly littering and there is no way to stop in sight. Littering is too big of a problem in the world today and is just unstoppable. Countries spend millions sometimes even billions trying to combat littering but with no fix in sight. Its impossible to stop littering because its already caused so many problems.</p>
